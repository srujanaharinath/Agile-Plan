Role: QA Engineer
As a QA Engineer, your role is to ensure the websiteâ€™s file upload functionality only accepts PDF files. You will test, identify, and report defects, and collaborate with the development team to implement and verify necessary changes.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Client-Side Restriction: File selection must be limited to `.pdf` files only, with an error message for other formats: "Invalid file format. Only PDF files are allowed."
2. Server-Side Validation: The server must reject any non-PDF files and provide an error message: "Upload failed. Only PDF files are allowed."
3. User Feedback: Confirm successful uploads with: "File uploaded successfully."
